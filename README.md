Washy Warriors, the Handwashing Arcade Machine. A 3.007 project by Daniel, Royston, Kai Jie, Nyssa and Faizaan.
Designed to help children commit to memory the proper handwashing techniques and steps, by gamification of an otherwise mundane process.

Our team wrote a simple motion-sensing game in Scratch, where germ sprites are generated and superimposed onto a live camera feed of the players hands. They are to follow on-screen prompts to emulate the 7 steps of handwashing, and score points by eliminating germs in the process.
The game is motion-activated via PIR sensor when the player reaches for the soap.

Thanks for dropping by!
