Washy Warriors, the Handwashing Arcade Machine. 
Designed to help children commit to memory the proper handwashing techniques and steps, by gamification.
Our team wrote a simple game in Scratch, where germ sprites are generated and superimposed onto a live camera feed of the players hands. They are to follow on-screen prompts to eliminate germs.
The game is motion-activated via PIR sensor when the player reaches for the soap.

Thanks for dropping by!
